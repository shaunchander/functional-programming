# Let's learn ReScript

To make the process of learning a new language more engaging, I've decided to create this monorepo to hold all of my ReScript projects, both small and large!

I intend for this monorepo to not only document my journey into learning ReScript, but also as a reference for developers who'd also like to pickup the language.

That's basically it!

## What is ReScript?

If you don't know, [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) is a programming language similar in form and function to TypeScript and JavaScript but with even stronger type safety. It also uses similar syntax from the oCaml programming language. I mainly like ReScript because of its functional programming approach to things and not to mention it compiles down into easy-to-read JS so it works with any JS tooling today!
