# ðŸ¤” What is this?

I've made a monorepo to publicly showcase my journey into learning functional programming concepts using ReScript!

I intend for this repo to hold any beginner, intermediate, and advanced projects (both boring and practical) that revolve around concepts in functional programming.

I may start blogging about this or maybe make videos as I practice these concepts over time and get more familiar with functional programming.

## What is ReScript?

If you don't know, [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) is a programming language similar in form and function to TypeScript and JavaScript but with even stronger type safety. It also uses similar syntax from the oCaml programming language. I mainly like ReScript because of its functional programming approach to things and not to mention it compiles down into easy-to-read JS so it works with any JS tooling today!

## Why functional programming

I think the main reason FP appeals to me over OOP is because it's easy-to-read and forces you to use immutable data structures, thus completely removing a whole world of bugs from your applications.

I am a total beginner when it comes to FP but these two fundamental concepts of FP appeal to me greatly!
